# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts to start project

AS project need to send through email i am removing node_module you can install
through below command before running start command
### `npm install`

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.


## Project using API key and google map key is part env file
Google map key is a development test key from common account as my key was not working.

So it is giving some dev mode popup which will be not there if the key is correct.
So kindly ignore that. You can use your own key as well.
